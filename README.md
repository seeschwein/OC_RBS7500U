OpenCore Razer Blade Stealth 2016 intel i7 7500U Hackintosh configuration

this model is a headache. furthermore, I got this unit secondhand and it already had a faulty display connection resulting in random blackouts. as a fun project, I'll try getting it to run macOS 14 Mojave. I know I could do Catalina and Big Sur is out, but I don't like them.
